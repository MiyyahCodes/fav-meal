     <h3>Origin of Jollof Rice</h3>
     <p>In West Africa, sacred Jollof rice is a fragrant dish that is revered across the sub-region for its unique sweet taste and subtle spiciness. It is also the source of heated discussion online among Nigerians, Ghanaians and Senegalese as to who owns the bragging rights to the dish. However, in order to understand the magic of Jollof or who can rightfully lay claim to it, first its history must be understood.
Jollof is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West Africa among the Wolof people, where it is known as benachin. The mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of the frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, it has evolved into several regional varieties, laced with the heritage of the place where it is prepared. Nevertheless, it maintains its magic and is relished all over Africa.</p>
      <p>For those who aren’t familiar with Jollof rice and are wondering how a rice dish can pack so much punch, the secret is in how it soaks up so much flavour. You would not imagine that boiling plain rice in the same pot as peppers, tomatoes, spices and meats would create such soft, yet crisp tomato-stained grains, with so much sweetness locked inside them. Another advantage that Jollof rice has over other Nigerian dishes is that it can be enjoyed with a healthy range of other condiments such as salads, avocado and deep-fried plantains. So if you’re feeling adventurous and trust your culinary skills, why not try out this authentic Nigerian Jollof rice recipe.</p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <strong>For the sauce, blend together:</strong>
  <ul>
<li>3 Red Bell Pepper
  <li>3 Tomatoes Plum
    <li>2 Scotch bonnet
      <li>1 Onion Diced
</ul>
<strong>For the main dish:</strong>
<ol>
       <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft.</li>
       <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper—about 15 minutes.</li>
       <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, white pepper, and seasoning cubes. Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Stir the rice into the sauce until it is well coated. Then add the chicken stock, stir, and cover with a tight-fitting lid, and then bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
       <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off the heat. Cover it immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little.</li>
       <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>
    </ol>
